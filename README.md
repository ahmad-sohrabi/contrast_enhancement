# Contrast Enhancement
In This Project, Linear stretch and histogram equalization are implemented from scratch.

## Histogram Equalization
The histogram equalization can be explained as is in this statement "Transforming an image with arbitrary histogram to one with flat histogram"
<br />
Histogram equalization algorithm is implemented from scratch.
## Linear Stretch
Linear stretch is in fact enhancing the dynamic range of image to a custom expected range
<br />
Linear Stretch algorithm is implemented from scratch.

## Additional Functionalities
Cropping image is another function that is implemented for this project.
